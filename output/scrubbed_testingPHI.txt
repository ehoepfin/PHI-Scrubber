HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: PERSON is a 6-year-old white male, who was sent from the Emergency Room with the diagnosis of intracranial bleeding. He was found by the 8-year-old sister in the bathroom. 
He was laying down on one side, and he was crying and moaning. The sibling went and told the parents. The parents rushed to the bathroom, they found him crying, and he was not moving the left side of his body. 
He was initially alert, but his alertness diminished. They decided to take him to the emergency room in Hospital, where a CT was done on his head, which showed a 4 x 4 x 2.5 cm bleed. 
The emergency physician called our emergency room, and I decided to involve PERSON, Dr. PERSON, the physician assistant, who is on call for the Neurosurgery Services. 
Collectively, they have made arrangements with the ICU attendings to have the child transported to our emergency room. For a small stop, I am obtaining an MRI and then admitting to the ICU. History was taken from the parents. 
He had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, otherwise, a healthy child.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: In the emergency room, at the time when I saw him, Dr. PERSON and Dr. PERSON were from the ICU and Anesthesia Services arrived also, and they evaluated PERSON with me and pretty much they took care of the patient. 
They decided to give him a dose of IV mannitol. I ordered his labs, type and cross. CBC is 15.6 white blood cell count, hemoglobin 12.8. PT/PTT were ordered due to the bleed, which was seen intracerebrally. They were 13.1 and 24.5 respectively. 
Blood gas, I-STAT pH 7.36, pCO2 is 51. This was a venous specimen. The ICU attendings decided to do a rapid sequence intubation. This was done in our emergency room by Dr. PERSON and Dr. PERSON. 
The patient was sent to the MRI, and from where he was going to be admitted to the ICU in critical condition.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES: Arteriovenous malformation, stroke, traumatic injury.

PLAN: I will have the patient followup with her physician at the ABC Clinic in two days for reevaluation. The patient was advised to stop drinking alcohol, and taking Cristie as this is not only in the interest of her health, but was also illegal.
